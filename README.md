## Hello! 👋
  I am a Master's Student at the **Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences** in the **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences** (QMSS) Program, following the **Data Science** focus. I received my Bachelor of Economics from **Nagoya University**, and spent early 2022 to late-mid 2025 living in Japan.  
  Nice to meet you!  
## My Interests 💡  
  My first semester at Columbia has inspired interest in understanding the mechanisms and applications of various Machine Learning models, practicing Python, and understanding how to wield LLMs as a tool for good. Specifically, learning about the "under the hood" math behind machine learning models, particularly neural networks, has motivated me to deepen my understanding of Linear Algebra.  
## I’m currently working on... 🏗  
  In the spirit of deepening my understanding of Linear Algebra, I began brainstorming ideas for a research project where I could apply LA to some form of social science analysis. This led me to:  
  ### ✨ Spectral Graph Theory ✨  
  Where I am aiming to answer the following research question:  
  > _Has the United States Senate undergone a topological phase transition? Specifically, can we use Spectral Graph Theory to mathematically prove that the Senate has evolved from a connected, multi-dimensional social network into a disconnected, one-dimensional bipartite graph?_  

This has involved translating Senator voting matrices into adjacency matrices, and converting those into Laplacian matrices, which I can then find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of for analysis. The preliminary results are very fascinating! I aim to publish my findings to a repository in due time!
